# Create your package

A package has been created to speed-up the development. Install the package globally.

    composer require global railken/amethyst-skeleton
    
If this is your first global composer package, you have to add the composer path

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin
    
Now you can execute the command 

    skeleton <name>
