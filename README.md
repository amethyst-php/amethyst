The purpose of this project it's to create a collection of packages to facilitate the developing process of common problems when building the backend of a crm.

Each component/data has his own package. The user has his own package, the authentication has his own package, the registration, the notification and so on; all fully configurabile.
For this reason it can be hard to start with it, this is when the [starter](docs/starter.md) comes in: with a bunch of packages added and already installed you can start to test all the features.

This package provides only the backend with a sets of endpoints, so a frontend it's still required. You can write your own or use [this](https://github.com/railken/vue-admin-start).
